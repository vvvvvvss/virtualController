# virtualController
## 1. Aim:
To design and develop a Virtual VibroLuxController system that controls volume and brightness using hand gestures.

## 2. Working Principle:
The Virtual VibroLuxController uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect hand gestures and control volume and brightness accordingly. The system utilizes:

- Hand tracking algorithms (e.g., OpenCV)
- Gesture recognition techniques (e.g., Mediapipe)

## 3. Components Used:

- Python programming language
- OpenCV library
- Mediapipe framework

## 4. Implementation:
The Virtual VibroLuxController system will be implemented using the following steps:

1. Hand tracking and gesture recognition
2. Training machine learning models for gesture recognition
3. Testing and debugging

## 5. Picture of the Model:


## 6. Result:
The Virtual VibroLuxController system successfully controls volume and brightness using hand gestures, providing a convenient and innovative solution for users.

## 7. Future Scope:
Future enhancements include:

- Expanding gesture recognition capabilities
- Integrating with smart home devices
- Developing mobile and web applications

## 8. Limitations:
Current limitations include:

- Dependence on lighting conditions
